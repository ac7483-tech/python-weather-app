# Advanced Weather Dashboard

This is a Python-based desktop application designed to provide users with comprehensive weather information for any specified city. Utilizing the Tkinter library for its graphical user interface and integrating with the OpenWeatherMap API, the application delivers real-time current conditions, hourly forecasts, and a multi-day outlook.

## Features

*   **Current Weather Conditions:** Displays live temperature, "feels like" temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, visibility, and sunrise/sunset times.
*   **Hourly Forecast:** Presents an 8-period hourly forecast, including temperature and brief descriptions.
*   **Daily Forecast:** Offers a 5-day weather outlook with maximum and minimum temperatures and general conditions.
*   **Additional Information:** Provides supplementary data such as cloudiness, wind gusts, sea-level pressure, and geographical coordinates.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Features a real-time clock and automatically updates weather data periodically for the last searched city.
*   **Error Handling:** Includes robust error handling for API call failures, network issues, and invalid city inputs.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   `requests` library (`pip install requests`)
*   Tkinter (typically included with Python installations)
*   An API key from OpenWeatherMap (or a compatible weather service)

## Setup and Usage

1.  **Obtain an API Key:** Register for a free API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2.  **Insert API Key:** Open the `weather_app.py` file and replace `"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
3.  **Run the Application:** Execute the Python script:
    ```bash
